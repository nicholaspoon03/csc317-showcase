# Description
I produced images to a scene where I progressively increase the amount of directional lighting in it. Then, I stitch these images together to create a video of slowly increasing more lighting in the scene. This can also be used as a screen saver, which was my original inspiration. Similar to A3, these lights follow Blinn Phong's model and contains diffuse, specular, and ambient properties.

# Acknowledgements
In addition to the original libraries used in A3, I have also used the `random` library.

# Piece
The piece has been uploaded to Markus but can also be found as `piece.mp4`.

# Compilation Verification
The compilation verification can be found as `compilation_verification.mov` in this repository. It has not been uploaded to Markus as it is too large.
